\section{Introduction}
 In this article i will try to solve with a geneartive model that describes the world of Poker (Texas Holdm)  agent, each step the agent will need to choose the optimal move (given the cards) in way that maximize the expectation value of winning  ,due the fact the world is described by generative model , we could point why the agent decdied to play with a particular move, from this implementation we could maybe genralize to the world of decision support system (dss) when proffesionals need to take decision and make actions about the world when there are some hidden information, neural networks approach as a disadvantage because the proffesional can't say why a specific action is the optimal.
\section{Model}
will introduce number notations and probablility distirbutions
\section{Implemetation}
the implemenatation framework is
\section{Results}
the quality of the output of the agent
\section{Summery}
\section{Related Work}
DeepStack - working with deeplearning.
there is none genearive models that i find that try to solve it
