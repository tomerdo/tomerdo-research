\maketitle
\section{Introduction}
in this article i will write a review on performance of diffrenet programing languages that used for probabilistic programming , regarding to how they handle models with stochastic structure, expanding of the idea that introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00704
\section{Implementation}
the code and link to github
\section{Results}
a table that decribes that comparison of results
\section{Summery}
the improvment of the algorithms
\section{Discussion}
add references
